    <h1>Good to see that you are keeping up with your piano skills...</h1>

    <p>Time to test your memory of 2049 Goodrich Avenue...</p>

    <p>Take the zip code of the Goodrich avenue house and add the second and third digits, this is the first number on one of the locks.</p>

    <p>Take the number of blocks that you have to walk from the Goodrich house to Davanniâ€™s and multiply it by 10, this is the second number for the same lock.</p>

    <p>Take the number of bathrooms that the Goodrich house had and multiply it by two, this is the third number to the same lock.</p>

    <p>Good luck!</p>
